# MusicNFT Platform

## Project Title
**MusicNFT Platform** - A Decentralized Music NFT Marketplace with Automatic Royalty Distribution

## Project Description
MusicNFT Platform is a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) that enables musicians and artists to mint their music as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), sell them directly to fans, and automatically receive royalties from secondary sales. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, the platform eliminates intermediaries and ensures artists maintain control over their intellectual property while receiving fair compensation for their work.

The platform allows artists to:
- Mint their music tracks as unique NFTs with metadata including title and genre
- Set custom royalty percentages for ongoing revenue from resales
- List their music NFTs for sale at desired prices
- Automatically receive royalty payments whenever their NFTs are resold
- Withdraw accumulated earnings seamlessly

Collectors and music fans can discover, purchase, and trade music NFTs while supporting their favorite artists directly.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the music industry by creating a decentralized ecosystem where:

1. **Artist Empowerment**: Musicians have complete control over their music distribution and pricing without relying on traditional record labels or streaming platforms that take significant revenue cuts.

2. **Fair Compensation**: Artists receive immediate payment for sales and automatic royalty payments from all future resales, ensuring ongoing revenue streams from their creative work.

3. **Direct Fan Connection**: Eliminate intermediaries between artists and fans, allowing direct support and engagement through NFT ownership.

4. **Transparent Ecosystem**: All transactions, royalty payments, and ownership transfers are recorded on the blockchain, providing complete transparency and trust.

5. **Global Accessibility**: Enable artists from anywhere in the world to monetize their music without geographical restrictions or complex licensing agreements.
